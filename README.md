## Ongoing Project: Advanced Sentiment Analysis in Football Subreddit Discussions

### Overview

I am currently working on developing an advanced sentiment analysis framework tailored to the nuanced discourse within football subreddit communities. This project, supervised by Dr. Ayah Helal at the University of Exeter, aims to accurately identify and quantify a broad spectrum of emotions and detect sarcasm, addressing the limitations of current sentiment analysis tools.

### Objectives

- **Comprehensive Emotion Spectrum Analysis:** To categorize and quantify sentiments across a wide range of emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, and more, specific to the sports discourse community.
- **Advanced Sarcasm Detection:** To refine sarcasm detection techniques, ensuring the accurate identification of sarcasm within subreddit discussions.
- **Model Development and Validation:** Employing and fine-tuning machine learning models for emotion analysis and sarcasm detection, with a focus on deep learning approaches like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformer models.

### Significance

This project aims to enhance our understanding of digital social interactions within specific interest groups, offering insights that can improve community management, content moderation, and user engagement strategies on social media platforms.

## Past Projects

- **Anti-Phishing LLM:** Pioneered the world's first Anti-Phishing solution using cutting-edge LLMs.
- **Look-Alike Audience Model:** Boosted customer acquisition by 30% through a machine learning-driven model.
- **Churn Prediction Model:** Reduced customer churn by 15% with an XG-Boost-based prediction model.
